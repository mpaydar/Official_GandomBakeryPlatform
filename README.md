# Official_GandomBakeryPlatform



#### PHASE 1 — Requirements, System Architecture & Prototyping 

Deliverables

• Final requirements document (ordering, admin dashboard, inventory logic, loyalty, notifications)

• System architecture diagram:

 – Backend: Next.js (App Router + API routes on Vercel)
 
 – Database schema

 – API gateway design
 
 – Real-time messaging (WebSockets/Kafka?)
 
• Technology decisions + justification

• Wireframes for bakery admin dashboard + customer ordering UI

• GitHub repo structure, CI skeleton, environment provisioning

• Proof-of-concept for order creation → bakery confirmation flow

## Deploy (Vercel)

The app lives in `frontend/`. In Vercel, set **Root Directory** to `frontend`, connect Postgres (`DATABASE_URL`), and set `JWT_SECRET_KEY`. The legacy Python/FastAPI `backend/` folder has been removed.
